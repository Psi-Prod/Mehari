val response_document :
  ?mime:Mehari.mime -> Eio.Fs.dir Eio.Path.t -> Mehari.response
(** Same as {!val:Mehari.response} but respond with content of file located at
    path. If [mime] parameter is not supplied, use {!val:Mehari.no_mime} as
    mime type. The whole file content is not loaded in memory: response is
    chunked. *)

val static :
  ?handler:(Eio.Fs.dir Eio.Path.t -> handler) ->
  ?dir_listing:(string list -> handler) ->
  ?index:string ->
  ?show_hidden:bool ->
  Eio.Fs.dir Eio.Path.t ->
  handler
(** [static dir] validates the path parameter (retrieved by
    calling [Mehari.param req 1]) by checking that it is relative and does not
    contain parent directory references. If these checks fail,
    responds with {!val:Mehari.not_found}.

    If the checks succeed, [static] calls [handler path request],
    where [path] is the path generated by the concatenation of directory that
    was passed to [static] and path of request. [handler] defaults to
    {!val:response_document}.

    If a directory is requested, [static] will look for a file named
    [index] in that directory to return. Otherwise, a directory file listing
    will be generated by calling [dir_listing [ filename; ... ] request].
    [index] is default on [index.gmi].

    [show_hidden] decides whether hidden files should be listed. It defaults to
    [false] for security reasons. *)

(** [run ?port ?backlog ?addr ?config ~certchains net handler] runs the server
    using [handler].

      - [port] is the port to listen on. Defaults to [1965].
      - [backlog] is the the number of pending connections that can be queued
        up. Defaults to [4096].
      - [timeout] is a couple of form [(duration, eio_clock)]. [duration] is
        the maximum waiting time in seconds for the client to write a request
        after TLS handshake. Unset by default.
      - [addr] is the socket addresses. Defaults to
        [Eio.Net.Ipaddr.V4.loopback].
      - [config] is the TLS server configuration.
        Defaults to
        {@ocaml[
          Tls.Config.server ~certificates
              ~authenticator:(fun ?ip:_ ~host:_ _ -> Ok None)
              ()
        ]}
        To support client certificates, specify the [authenticator].
      - [certchains] is the list of form [[(cert_path, private_key_path); ...]],
        the last one is considered default.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [certchains] is empty. *)
