include Mehari.NET with module IO := Direct and type addr = Eio.Net.Ipaddr.v4v6

(** {1 Response} *)

val response_document : ?mime:Mehari.mime -> Eio.Fs.dir Eio.Path.t -> Mehari.response
(** Same as {!val:Mehari.response} but respond with content of file located at
    path. If [mime] parameter is not supplied, use {!val:Mehari.no_mime} as
    mime type. The whole file content is not loaded in memory: response is
    chunked. *)

val static :
  ?show_hidden:bool ->
  Eio.Fs.dir Eio.Path.t ->
  'a Mehari.request ->
  Mehari.response
(** [static ?show_hidden dir] validates the path substituted by the first path
    parameter of request (by calling [Mehari.param req 1]) by cheking that it
    is relative and does not contain parent directory references. If these
    checks fail, responds with {!type:Mehari.status} {!val:Mehari.not_found}.

    A directory listing is generated if the path parameter of the query is a
    directory. *)

(** [run ?port ?backlog ?addr ?config ~certchains net handler] runs the server using
    [handler].
      - [port] is the port to listen on. Defaults to [1965].
      - [backlog] is the the number of pending connections that can be queued
        up. Defaults to [4096].
      - [timeout] is a couple of form [(duration, eio_clock)]. [duration] is
        the maximum waiting time in seconds for the client to write a request
        after TLS handshake. Unset by default.
      - [addr] is the socket addresses. Defaults to
        [Eio.Net.Ipaddr.V4.loopback].
      - [config] is the TLS server configuration.
        Defaults to
        {@ocaml[
          Tls.Config.server ~certificates
              ~authenticator:(fun ?ip:_ ~host:_ _ -> Ok None)
              ()
        ]}
        To support client certificates, specify the [authenticator].
      - [certchains] is the list of form [[(cert_path, private_key_path); ...]],
        the last one is considered default.

      @raise Invalid_argument if [certchains] is empty. *)
