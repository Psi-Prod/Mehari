# Mehari

Mehari is a [Mirage OS](https://mirageos.org/) friendly library for building Gemini servers. It fully implements the [Gemini protocol specification](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi) and aims to expose a clean and simple API.

It takes heavy inspiration from [Dream](https://github.com/aantron/dream), a tidy, feature-complete Web framework.
